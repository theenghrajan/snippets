If you are saying to use 'allclearplumbing25@gmail.com' as SMTP (email that forms will send to the client recipient's inbox). Please add to the Passbolt Folder with 2FA turned on via TOTP, or you can follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPGgMvxi_Rw.

Task Title - #87: Blog Page and Individual Blog Page
Project Title - Sandusky Milan RV Park [SEO]

As per comments #6 - #7,

1. Since the website, https://sanduskymilanrvpark.com/ is built on WordPress using DIVI builder, we may not be able to match the blog page design using the builder due to the limitations. However, we'll do our best to replicate the design as closely as possible within the builder's capabilities. We will proceed on dev for review.

2. As per our understanding, 

	- We will remove this block (see screenshot below).
	SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKt7Ru1VG_z8H5P4WuAPkF7wigx77QLm/view?usp=sharing

	- We will implement the form as per the design with standard action. Should form submissions be sent to the current admin email (SMRVParkOhio@gmail.com)? Or would you prefer a different recipient address?

3. We have approximately estimated around 8 to 12 hours and might increase if any futher updates are require. Please approve our estimation and then we will proceed with the task.



We need to test further by deactivating some cache plugins as there are multiple active cache plugins are installed. Only one caching plugin should be active for better performance.


As per comment #5,

For the website:- https://mrpoolleakrepair.com/

1. Multiple caching plugins were active, such as Nitropack and Asset CleanUp, which caused conflicts and led to the issues. We’ve temporarily deactivated Nitropack to resolve the problem, and the mobile version now appears to be working as well.

2. Please create a separate task for further investigation and review of the caching issues. If Nitropack needs to be activated.
