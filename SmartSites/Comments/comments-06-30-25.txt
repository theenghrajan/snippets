=========================================

We've published the custom HTML landing page live at https://yampaglia-law.com/fighting-for-you/.
Fullpage SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ntWYrSsnxWLk95qjb0t6LB2dwIvY6QIa/view?usp=sharing

We've tested the form (SMTP ID leadsyampaglia@gmail.com) and it is working fine (see screenshots below),
Thank you message ss - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hUdwkkQhKB7-akViM8kaVS1Wkltr3TJD/view?usp=sharing
Admin email ss - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFblD7qnVEUkr61RmYdYprbhFExUjXKo/view?usp=sharing
User email ss - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pX-Emcr3zMcVJleDPllTNrZcj59HHQfE/view?usp=sharing

After testing the form, we've changed the email recipient to 'm.florendo7@gmail.com' as mentioned in comment #1.

We've also implemented form validation (valid Phone Number, Email Contains @ in it) and add SPAM controls (reCAPTCHA, Honeypot, CSRF, Referrers).

1. Form validation (valid Phone Number, Email Contains @ in it)
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TSb-5YSUW_f8n4b0Nxw53iM8BKRv8H9x/view?usp=sharing

2. SPAM controls
a. Honeypot Field
By adding a hidden field to the form (e.g., ) that humans won’t fill in.
On the server side, we have checked if this field has a value. If it does, it’s likely a bot and we have discard the submission.
If this is filled, it will display "spam detected" and will prevent the form submission.

b. Session or Token-Based Validation
Used CSRF tokens to ensure that the request originated from a trusted source. By generating a unique token on form load, store it in the session, and verify it upon submission. If it does not match, we have discard the submission.

c. Restrict Allowed Referrers
Checked the HTTP referrer header to ensure that the form submission originates from the LP URL and not another. If it does not match with the LP URL, we have discard the submission.

d. Google Re-captcha
We have added server-side validation for the captcha field.

As per comment #7,

We're currently developing the landing pages using custom HTML excluding the forms, as they will be integrated separately using the Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin. We will provide a progress update by tomorrow, Tuesday, June 1st, and the due date has been set accordingly.

To deploy these landing pages in draft mode on the live site for your review before publishing, we'll need FTP/cPanel or direct hosting access. Currently, we only have CMS admin access.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Ak5HvikG6bJAv4XEY7pTJ4tMpMJIxnB/view?usp=sharing

Since the active theme was developed by another agency, we'll also need hosting access to review its code structure. This will ensure our new custom landing pages are properly aligned and integrated.

We couldn't find any login credentials in the Workbook, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lHnBXoibUmcaT8A_Z_hBoTDHiUJfCHNY_e587FUU8Jg/edit?gid=1214113832#gid=1214113832. Please provide detailed access information.

Could you confirm if the landing page content should be dynamic/editable? We will currently proceed with a static WordPress page template, which also requires hosting (file management level) access.

Notes:
According to our task proceeding rules, please provide all necessary access details (FTP/cPanel/Hosting/domain) on a separate task, https://login.smartsites.com/projects/7145/tasks/370007, so we can check in detail to ensure a smooth launch.
