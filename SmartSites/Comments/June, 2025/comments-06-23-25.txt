As per comment #9,

We’re unable to display a popup directly from Mailchimp itself. Typically, the popup needs to be either embedded on a specific page or triggered by integrating Mailchimp with the website.

To proceed with this setup, please provide delegated access to the web@smartsites.com Mailchimp account so we can review the configuration and move forward. Also, kindly confirm whether the popup should appear sitewide or only on a specific page or form.

We noticed that you’ve shared a screenshot showing where the popup should appear. However, we’re currently unsure which exact page the screenshot corresponds to. Could you please clarify this so we can ensure the popup is implemented in the correct location?

Please review and let us know your feedback.

Thank you!
