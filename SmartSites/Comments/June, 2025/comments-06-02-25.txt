As per comment #42,

We cannot block emails sent to tummytuck.solutions@gmail.com when clients reply to the thank-you message, as free Gmail accounts do not offer the ability to block incoming emails.

To address this, we recommend the following options:

1. Use a HIPAA-Compliant Email Address
Replace tummytuck.solutions@gmail.com with a HIPAA-compliant email address, such as one set up through Google Workspace with a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

This secure email can be used to send the thank-you message and any client replies will then be received through a HIPAA-compliant inbox, ensuring sensitive data is protected.

2. Use a No-Reply Address With a Disclaimer
Create an address like no-reply.solutions@gmail.com so users understand not to respond.

In the thank-you message, include a note such as:
“Please do not reply to this email. If you have questions, contact us at [secure contact link or phone number].”

However, this only discourages replies—it doesn't prevent them. Users can still technically reply to the message.

Regarding Forwarding Emails: It is technically possible to forward replies from tummytuck.solutions@gmail.com to the client’s email address. However, this is not HIPAA-compliant.

Even if the email is forwarded, the sensitive information first lands in the non-compliant Gmail inbox, potentially exposing protected health information.

A better approach would be to send the thank-you message directly from a HIPAA-compliant email address owned by the client. That way, if a customer replies, the data remains secure and compliant with HIPAA regulations.

Thank You!

Re: Is there a reason you can't do this same thing on the location pages?
>> If you are referring to the reviews then we've added them, thanks for the information. Otherwise, inform us if we are missing anything here.

Re: For the photo, can you use the same photo that is being used here for reach location and use that as a header image?
https://hempgeneration.com/stores/
>> We are bit unclear about which header image, should we update the image with? Could you provide more information, maybe with the screenshots for more clarity.

Re: Yes, there should be CTA that says "Location Info" under the "View Flower Menu" for each location that links to each respective page. The photos for each location should also be clickable and link to the page for each location.
>> We've updated CTA 'Location Info' and photos for each location to be linked accordingly.
