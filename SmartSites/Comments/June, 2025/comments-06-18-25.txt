Re: SMTP

However, we require the another level of 2FA to proceed with SMTP setup process.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gmyQWU2uobKL3VuaaBbLNpiZ864zKdb9/view?usp=sharing

We attempted to use the "More ways to verify" option, but there's no option available for Authenticator (TOTP code setup on passbolt).
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zRWIotVX-e_vqItIrxPX1ysI6X15m7ug/view?usp=sharing

We need to coordinate for 2FA and we will be available at 12 PM NJ. Please confirm.

Currently, we’ve set up SMTP using our development Google account for temporary use. However, there is a form submission issue due to the quota limit.

As mentioned earlier, we’ll need to coordinate for 2FA at the scheduled time in order to proceed with setting up the proper SMTP configuration.

Re: Header and Footer Form

Re: Newsletter Form
>> We've implemented this form as a standard HTML form for now. Since the placeholder/label says 'Your Message' and the submit button says 'Subscribe', we'd like to clarify whether this form is intended to include any subscription functionality? 

If yes, then please provide detailed information. Otherwise, the form will function as a standard contact form that simply submits the user's message. 

Please confirm whether the current field should be updated or if the form should be removed for now.

Re: Also the client mentioned this spammy form fill coming through once of the contact forms from a platform called lensa.com a job posting site. please let me know if there's another layer of protection we can add to the contact forms to reduce spam

>> Upon inspecting the forms on the site, we found that both reCAPTCHA and a honeypot are already implemented. These should be effective in blocking most bot-generated spam.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/109b0pVI-oLEhuYBMU8wrrLCpB57Bjokf/view?usp=sharing

We also reviewed the form entries and did not find any submissions that appear to be spam. However, if the client is receiving irrelevant messages, we can provide a spreadsheet containing all form entries. From there, you can identify the Gmail addresses or other email accounts that are sending irrelevant messages, and we can block them using the https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-email-blacklist/ plugin. 

The Email Blacklist plugin is already implemented on the site. If you can provide a list of email addresses that need to be blocked, we can add them to the plugin to prevent further submissions.

Please let us know how you’d like to proceed.
