=======================================
On the CPTED page at /cpted/ (https://zh0.fd3.mytemp.website/cpted/)
1. The hover color-change effect on the items under the "What’s Included in Our Flat-Rate CPTED Package" header washes out the icons, and hides the bullet points and header text.
2. The "Take a free CPTED test" widget auto-scrolls underneath the top banner on hitting "next" or "previous" - hiding the top of the questionnaire.

=========================================

We will be updating the form fields to be as following:-

Bluehost 2FA SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1otY2FU2Wrqj0c5ENDEkMpsxsmnQuQocm/view?usp=sharing

We need to co-ordinate for 2FA with the client. Please confirm, we will be available at 12:00 PM NJ EST for the co-ordination.

FYI:
Alternatively if possible, could you verify with the client if they would add our Smartsites Bluehost account user as a collaborator? This would allow us to retrieve the 2FA codes without time constraints.
Name: Smartsites
Email: web@smartsites.com

If necessary, for additional guidance on managing users and roles in Bluehost's Account Manager, you can refer to the following support article as well:

Re: Landing Page Design
>> We've proceed with the landing page development and are in progress currently with the Figma link provided in comment #5, i.e. https://www.figma.com/design/qN3wQkX5S1mlBQKYo8899b/Elixens-America--PPC---7_-Design-Custom-Landing-Page--FED-?node-id=9121-775&m=dev.

Just wanted to confirm that we're using the correct Figma link, as you've mentioned this is the most updated link. However, during the development of the landing page, we noticed that the logos and content don't appear to align with the 'Cyclone Wellness' brand, instead match with the another project's landing page task: https://login.smartsites.com/projects/6983/tasks/359089. Please let us know if we're overlooking anything, and if possible, provide more detailed information or clarification.
