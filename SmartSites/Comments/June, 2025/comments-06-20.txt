Since, we're still on development phase, we've set the email to 'frontend@smartsites.com' for testing purposes. We will change it to 'd.crandall@iconjds.com' and install reCAPTCHA/Honeypot once the landing page is live.

Re: 
Please remove the pasta dish from the middle.
Spanish version: "Contacta con nosotras" doesn't sound good. Change it to "contáctanos."

Re: I'm trying to search for The chefs idea using Google search, and I don't appear to be able to find it.
>> We are unclear with the mentioned requirement so could you please elaborate more? Kindly confirm if the requirement is about listing the LPs on the Google Search? As per our understanding the LPs are created specific for the PPC Campaigns, and they are not indexed on Google / Search. 

Re: Also the Clarity software is currently tracking only the Spanish version. Please configure the english site to track
>> Apologies. However, we haven't configured Clarity for the LPs yet. FED only set up the clarity for the main site as per the task: https://login.smartsites.com/projects/6058/tasks/331160. So kindly confirm if we need to implement the same clarity account for both LPs (English and Spanish Version)

Re: Replace node-sass: NPM package with sass or sass-embed  package.
We need to test first, fix breaking changes (leagacy code, for ex:- many @import/s), update build tools and so on. We won’t know all issues until we try and implement.

node-sass Replacement - Tests Needed 

We need to review and tested before being finalized.

main kuro bhaneko maintain or remove (unused or blank) ko kuro chan dherai jaso cha yo majjale review garna parcha jastai

migrate from node-sass -> sass or sass-embedded kochai test garnai parcha dherai leagcy code haru cha update garna parcha

Common Drawbacks and Issues haru huncha
- Syntax & Feature Differences
- Dependency Conflicts
- Inconsistent Output
- Build Tooling Adjustments

Need to ensure QA testing is done on:
- Layout changes
- Sass error handling
- Source map integrity
- Critical class outputs

We are currently in the process of pushing the blog page live and will be able to provide you with updates by Monday, 23rd June. Accordingly, we have adjusted the due date.
