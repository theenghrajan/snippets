Please confirm if we need to update the conversion action based on the newly updated number.

Re: Please also match the forms for each of them and use the icons from the bottom form in the top form 
>> We've updated the icons in the top form as well. However, we're bit unclear with the instructions whether we should add all the form fields i.e Full Name, Phone Number, Email, Address and Message on footer form as well, making the both forms with the same fields and the same validation for required fields?

>> Currently, the footer form has first three fields as required.
