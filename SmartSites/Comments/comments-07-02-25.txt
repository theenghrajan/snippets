Re: 4. Dialogtech Number Check - Make sure the PPC Dialogtech number is working.
>> The PPC phone number 254-651-3175 (Created by the IBM Team) is hardcoded on the site. FED has been only hardcoding the trackable number for the landing pages hosted under /lp or separate subdomain. 

However, in current scenario, as the LP is hosted on main domain, and the numbers is displayed for overall users (Whether organic or direct or paid). Thus, the ppc trackable number won't function properly, as its purpose is to display specific for the paid (id=ppc) campaigns

For such cases (In scenario where the Landing page is hosted on main domain), we have been adding the original number on the site. And, later when FED team is assigned tasks: https://login.smartsites.com/projects/6984/tasks/359108 or https://login.smartsites.com/projects/6984/tasks/359115, the trackable numbers are then configured for the site using the tracking script provided by the Backend Dev Team (Displayed specific for id=ppc => User’s visitors arriving on the site through paid ppc campaigns => Ads Campaign needs to include id=ppc parameter)

Thus, we suggest placing the original number on the site and display such number specific for Ads Campaign / id=ppc users. Please advice

Re: 5. Page Speed Check - run the site through a page speed analysis to ensure the page is running optimally.

We have checked all the points you have mentioned in the comment #2. If there are any other points from the task descriptions that also need to be checked, please let us know.

As per comments #9 - #10,

Once you get the necessary hosting access details from the client, please provide them on a separate task, https://login.smartsites.com/projects/7145/tasks/370007, so we can check in detail to ensure a smooth launch.

After you task assigned back to us, we will then proceed with WordPress dynamic custom page template and inform you of the due date for completion.

In the meantime, you can view our progress on custom HTML without forms below:-

As per comment #2,

Since you've mentioned that this will be a WordPress site, whereas the domain, http://stillwaterdayspa.com/, is currently only registered on IONOS and not yet hosted, we’d like to confirm the following before proceeding:

Are we developing the landing page from scratch, or is there any other existing website we’ll be working with?
You’ve mentioned to go ahead and code this on a test site and migrate it once live access is available. Please confirm if we can proceed with custom-coded development. For CMS (WordPress + Custom code), we will require FTP/cPanel/hosting or file manager level access to publish them live.

Currently, there is no dedicated test/dev space available. To ensure a smooth workflow, we recommend setting up a separate development environment before pushing changes live. We suggest opening a separate task for this setup.

Additionally, we can make the landing page content editable (dynamic) using WordPress. However, this will require additional working hours. Please confirm if CMS editing functionality is required for the landing page.

We’d like to confirm the following information as well before proceeding with development:

1. Email Recipient
You mentioned the form will be submitted to an "info@" address. We require the full and valid email address for form submissions.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxFXkWRPRM5JVn5e9Kp0i6B3pHJda7Ba/view?usp=sharing

2. SMTP Email Setup
We also require SMTP Email ID. Please add the credentials to the following Passbolt Folder, https://chamber.smartsites.com/app/folders/view/4f3c9c81-c90d-47ed-a564-1b2954b9c3a7, with 2FA turned on via TOTP (This is the email address that forms will send to the client - Demonstration video, https://app.fireflies.ai/view/PPC-Landing-Page-SMTP::01JN71SEVN92FW0W25EJBJZ7H7). Please ensure FED PM has edit access and FED has read access as well.

3. Form Integrations
Does the form have any special functionality or is to be fetched from a third party? Any integrations needed?

4. Thank You Message
We will be updating the following default Thank You Message after form submission:
"Thank you for your message, we will be in touch shortly. If you would like to speak with someone sooner, please call {phone number}."
Please let us know if there's a specific thank you message to follow.

5. Testimonials
We'll include the testimonials as in the design for now, please include a document/list of testimonials to include on the landing page if they should be updated/added.

6. Landing Page URL and Indexing
What URL should be used for the landing page?
Should it be placed on the main domain, http://stillwaterdayspa.com/?
As per our understanding, the LPs are created specifically for the PPC campaigns and are not meant to be indexed by Google/Search Engines.
Could you please confirm if the requirement is to index or keep hidden from search results?

7. Any Other Info
Is there any other information that you think might be useful for us to know?

After testing the form, we've changed the email recipient to 'm.florendo7@gmail.com' as mentioned in comment #1.

We've also implemented form validation (valid Phone Number, Email Contains @ in it) and add SPAM controls (reCAPTCHA, Honeypot, CSRF, Referrers).

1. Form validation (valid Phone Number, Email Contains @ in it)
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/11i_47P4dsdosHstuDBrYYZdxMiGuePnm/view?usp=sharing

2. SPAM controls
a. Honeypot Field
By adding a hidden field to the form (e.g., ) that humans won’t fill in.
On the server side, we have checked if this field has a value. If it does, it’s likely a bot and we have discard the submission.
If this is filled, it will display "spam detected" and will prevent the form submission.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/17TmvifPIt80ktTKXofF-2HYS8UYN4qD_/view?usp=sharing

b. Session or Token-Based Validation
Used CSRF tokens to ensure that the request originated from a trusted source. By generating a unique token on form load, store it in the session, and verify it upon submission. If it does not match, we have discard the submission.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z4K1B1wW8_FPV22BN0oZgEk0hQvQsLg-/view?usp=sharing

c. Restrict Allowed Referrers
Checked the HTTP referrer header to ensure that the form submission originates from the LP URL and not another. If it does not match with the LP URL, we have discard the submission.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1REKoxqJTg_hi7o6BbriWFjWMQHPL9rfG/view?usp=sharing

d. Google Re-captcha
We have added server-side validation for the captcha field.
