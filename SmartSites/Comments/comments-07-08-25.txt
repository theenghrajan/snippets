We've opened a new task and will continue our work there, https://login.smartsites.com/projects/6639/tasks/377200. Since we have no further work remaining on this task, please proceed to close it. If any work is still pending for the Design Team, kindly assign it to them.

Re: SMTP
>> We do not find SMTP ID login details in the Passbolt, https://chamber.smartsites.com/app/passwords/view/aa51f445-ed49-4e24-b53a-3a0d70b4ba8c. Please ensure FED PM has edit access and FED read access.

For now, we've set up SMTP with our development account, 'outbound@smartsites.com' but there's form submission issues due to quota limit. Please inform us once updated.
