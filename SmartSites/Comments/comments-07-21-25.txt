Regarding 'Area Served' section:
We're bit unclear with the response with only "Yes". Could you please confirm if we should proceed with making the section interactive? 

As we understand, the likely intended functionalities be:
- When a user clicks on a state in the list on the right, the corresponding on the map gets highlighted.
- Likewise, clicking a state on the map highlights the respective state in the list.

In the meantime, we will proceed with development on the dev site for your review and provides updates by Wednesday 23rd July.
