As per comment #10,

We have access to the site files with SFTP credentials provided on the WB (as screenshot you've attached) but we cannot access site database from the SFTP only. To proceed with cloning the live site to dev/local setup we require to have access to site database as well. Since site is hosted on WPEngine please ask the client to provide us with the delegated access on WPEngine for web@smartsites.com.
