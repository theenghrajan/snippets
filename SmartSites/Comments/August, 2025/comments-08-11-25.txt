Accurate Air [WP]

Since we're creating the new site on WordPress, we have a few queries before proceeding:

1. Form & Email Recipient
The form will be built using Gravity Forms and will require a recipient email address. Should we use info@accurateairinc.com, as listed on the current live site?

2. Review Process & 2FA Coordination
We will first provide updates on the dev site for your review and push live after your approval. However, there is currently 2FA enabled when trying to log in to Network Solutions using the credentials in Passbolt.
We will be available at 12 PM NJ EST today for 2FA coordination.

3. Task Dependency
We will begin creating the page on the dev site only after the completion of the following task: 
https://login.smartsites.com/projects/7383/tasks/387155

4. Estimation
Updating the page will require approximately 2–3 working hours.

Please confirm and inform on 2FA coordination so we can proceed with the live push after the page is completed.


As per the task descriptions,

As per the task descriptions,

The login credentials provided in the Passbolt are not working for the WuFoo form, so we are not able to update the form if needed. Please verify and update with the correct ones, if possible.

If you’d like to switch to Gravity Forms, we’d also like to know whether the existing WuFoo forms have any special functionalities or integrations. If the form is standard, we can simply replace it with a Gravity Form. Otherwise, we’d like to review any required functionalities in more detail before proceeding.

Additionally, we did not find a dev site currently configured for this project. Please proceed with setting up a dev site for review before pushing the changes live for smoother workflow. Please confirm and open the task: https://login.smartsites.com/projects/7345/tasks/384915 to proceed.
