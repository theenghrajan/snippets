1. We've updated the phone number ( 832 939 9330) and will add the email recipient for form to info@aestheticsbyanjelica.com once the landing page is live.

2. SMTP:
We do not create new Gmail for SMTP from on our end, this must be done from PM end. Please add this email to the Passbolt folder: https://chamber.smartsites.com/app/folders/view/4f3c9c81-c90d-47ed-a564-1b2954b9c3a7. Enable 2FA (TOTP) and ensure FED has read and update access.

3. Content:

We've updated the content as per the doc provided, however a few points remain unclear. Please review the following and provide clarification with detailed instructions (screenshots, if possible, would be helpful):

Re: Add a testimonial Below Hero CTA Button (new testimonial line):
Are you asking us to duplicate the existing testimonial section (currently placed at the bottom) and insert it just below Hero CTA button? Which would result duplicated sections in both bottom and hero?

Re:  Add Urgency Line (Directly Above or Below CTA Buttons)
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/13WGQyCgPD2fJfzii8K57o4TO6jopw3Mc/view?usp=sharing
Are you asking to add the new line: "Bonus: Includes tips from real NPTI graduates to help you get hired faster." below on every CTA buttons?
We've currently added this line under all CTA buttons.

Re: Move Testimonial Block Up

Do you mean to reposition only the two testimonial cards — Hannah Thikton and William Yund — and place them below the “Benefits” section? Also, could you confirm which exact section is being referred to as the "Benefits" section?

Please confirm the above points with more detail so we can proceed accordingly.
