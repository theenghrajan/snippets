>> Please make sure that this email address (cyclonewellnessleads@gmail.com) will only be used to send email from the landing page and should not be related to NameCheap (Current main domain, https://cyclonewellness.com/ is registered). 

If this email (cyclonewellnessleads@gmail.com) should be used as SMTP for the landing page. Please ensure 2FA is turned on as currently 2FA is not turned on (see screenshot below) and set up TOTP again for 2FA.
