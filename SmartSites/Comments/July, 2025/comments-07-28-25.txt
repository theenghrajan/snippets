It looks like there was a miscommunication here. As per Comment #9, we had understood that the instruction was to add a popup in Mailchimp, not to create a landing page. Later, the task seems to have shifted in a different direction, and we also noticed that new versions of the landing page were created.

We even asked for clarification in Comment #37 regarding which version to proceed with, but we were told to code both versions. So, based on Comment #9, we went ahead and created the landing page in Mailchimp.

Now in Comment #41, there's a request to move the Mailchimp landing page to a new hosting server, which is not directly possible because Mailchimp does not allow exporting landing pages.

So at this point, the only option is to recreate the landing page using custom HTML and CSS.

To proceed, we need a clear insight on:

1. What exactly needs to be done now?
2. What are the final requirements for the landing page?
3. Should we proceed with a custom HTML/CSS version based on the design provided in comment #35, and should the form in the landing page be integrated with Mailchimp?
4. Originally, the task was to add a popup in Mailchimp—what happened to that requirement? If a popup still needs to be added in Mailchimp, which design/version should we use for that popup?

Please confirm so we can move forward accordingly.

According to our task proceeding rules, we do not work on tasks related to the Design Team or any other specific team. Therefore, we have created a new task and will continue our work there: https://login.smartsites.com/projects/5656/tasks/382804. Since we have no further work remaining on this task, please proceed to close it. If any work is still pending for the Design Team, kindly assign it to them.

As per comment #8,

Since the website: https://yadkinfire.com/ is built using WPBakery Page Builder, we’re limited to its default features. Due to these platform constraints, we may not be able to fully match the provided design or implement extensive customizations and only updates that are achievable within WPBakery's capabilities. Also, the current WPBakery Page Builder plugin is not a pro version on the site so we will be unable use premium features as well.

Additionally, please note that the current WPBakery Page Builder plugin installed is not the premium (Pro) version, which further restricts access to advanced modules and features that may be required to achieve the desired layout or functionality.

Development Notes & Queries - Page Design & Content

Since the design isn’t too heavy, most of the blocks should be achievable within the platform. However, we're uncertain about the feasibility of the card-style blocks shown in the screenshot below, due to possible layout or responsiveness limitations:
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axL5EIGKIPj51CNBSPxe2lEH94EjRWzi/view?usp=sharing

Currently, the Figma file includes only one design layout (for Emergency Lighting Maintenance). We plan to reuse this same layout for the remaining individual service pages and will populate them with placeholder/dummy content for now, as specific content has not been provided.

Please provide the content and images for the remaining service pages, ensuring they are compatible with the existing layout. Let us know if any adjustments are needed.

Timeline & Process
- We will proceed with development on the dev site for your review.
- Once approved, we’ll push the pages live.

Estimated timeline: 
Development  = 10 – 12 hours
Content = 4 - 5 hours
Total = 14 - 17 hours

Please confirm the above details so we can begin development and let us know your feedback.

As per the task descriptions,

The location individual pages are new pages to be implemented but what about category/parent page design. Should it be not a page? As details are not updated in the 'New Website Plan': https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_bAi_uHURjtQH1sMhbLyV385IIJppyrL3TqQCGpv4T8/edit?gid=406948056#gid=406948056 such as Onsite SEO.

Development Notes & Queries:

Page Design & Content
There's only one design in the Figma file link (for Bayview). We will reuse the same layout for the remaining locations and populate the content and images based on the drive link provided in the task descriptions above.

Timeline & Process
- We will proceed with development on the live site on DRAFT mode for your review. As the dev site do not have Elementor Pro version activated.
- Once approved, we’ll push the pages live and submit them for Google indexing as well.

Estimated timeline:
