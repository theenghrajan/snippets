We've created a new page, as implementing the "Buy Now" button required manual code-level customization to replicate the existing live functionality. It has now been updated accordingly — clicking the button will add the product directly to the shopping cart. 
Please see the screen recording below for reference.

As per the task descriptions and comment #1,

Development Notes & Queries:
1. Regarding 'Area Served' section, is the map only image or needs to be interactive? If it should be interactive we suggest using plugin https://interactivegeomaps.com/. But using the plugin we will not be able to match the design, however we will try to match the map as in design.

2. Regarding 'Location Staff' section, could you please let us know where the 'View Profile' button link to?

We will proceed with development on the dev site for your review. Please see our estimation below and confirm to proceed.

Estimated hours: 
HTML = 12 - 14 hours
WP = 7 hours
----------------
Total = 19 - 21 hours

As per the comments #3 - #6,

Since these pages are already exist in the live site, we will be replacing them by our new design at last.
https://securetitlewatch.com/areas-we-serve/
https://securetitlewatch.com/areas-we-serve/florida/

Similary, we will add the locations as follow mentioned in the Workbook - New Website Plan with same URL structure:
Florida
California
Texas
New York

On the other hand, Service pages seems to be new page to build and only following individual service pages content have been provided instead there more listed in the Workbokk - New Website Plan:
- Home Title Monitoring
- Home Title Fraud Protection
- Property Monitoring Services

Design Team, we require images for them as well. So please provide them and re-assign the task then we proceed with the development.

Notes:- Since the site is built on Elementor, we’ll be working within its limitations. We’ll notify you of any platform constraints or issues we encounter during the build.
