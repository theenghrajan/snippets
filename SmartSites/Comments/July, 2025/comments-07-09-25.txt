Development Notes & Queries:

1. Page Design & Content
There's only one design in the figma file (for Calabasas, CA). We will reuse the same layout for the remaining locations and populate the content based on the text provided in the task - comment #1: https://login.smartsites.com/projects/6639/tasks/374080. 

However, we also require images (if they need to be updated/changed) on other location pages. The G-Drive also have the images as per the design.

2. Buttons Behavior:
We assume that the ‘Learn More’ buttons under the ‘Locations We Serve’ section should link to their corresponding individual location pages. 
Please confirm this and let us know where the other buttons should lead to?

Timeline & Process
- We will proceed with development on the dev site for your review.
- Once approved, we’ll push the pages live and submit them for Google indexing.
Estimated timeline: 14 – 16 hours

Notes:- Since the site is built on Elementor, we’ll be working within its limitations. We’ll notify you of any platform constraints or issues we encounter during the build.
Please confirm the above details so we can begin development.

As per comment #82,

The cpanel login credentials for the landing pages have been changed and currently mentioned in the Workbook are not working. We've requested the network admin to reset them. We’ll proceed once we receive the updated credentials.

For now, we've shifted due date to Friday, 11th July.

Email Forwarding Update:
We've updated the sarah@tfglaw.com to admin2@tfglaw.com. Emails will now be received at admin2@tfglaw.com (sarah@tfglaw.com will no longer receive them).
Before SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cnX7-zemTCTUZn_jB8UWV0Ot_Mm4yvkE/view
After SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5J_mXeT9gVR91gcK0lWDwO1MCeQq-72/view?usp=sharing

Notes: Email forwarding lists are only updated to the landing pages, not the main site. Please inform us if they should be updated on the main site as well.

Google Reviews Issue:
Re: Why do the CODE landing pages pull direct reviews from Google but not from the PPC landing page?
>> Should all the CODE landing pages display the same Google reviews (manually added) as the PPC landing page?

Re: All websites and landing pages should be pulling reviews from the client's Google Reviews/GMB.
>> Or, are you requesting dynamic Google reviews to be shown for all the website and landing pages?

Main Site: https://tfglaw.com/

Landing Pages:
https://lp.tfglaw.com/ppc/
https://lp.tfglaw.com/code-2/
https://lp.tfglaw.com/code-9/
https://lp.tfglaw.com/code-12/
https://lp.tfglaw.com/code-13/

Dynamic Google Reviews Setup:
To proceed with this, Google Maps API billing must be enabled: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup#billing

Charges will not apply as long as you stay within the monthly free quota. You can find details here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup

Please enable billing using the account noreplytfglaw@gmail.com (currently used for SMTP) and inform us. If you prefer to use another Google account, we will need login access and may require 2FA coordination to ensure proper setup.

Let us know how you'd like to proceed.
