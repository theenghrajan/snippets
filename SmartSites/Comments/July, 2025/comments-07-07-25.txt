As per comment #36,

For the landing page:- https://maximum-athletic.com/lp/

We've adjusted the spacing between the images. However, due to differences in width and height resolutions, we're unable to align them with others by width. 
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kkB43Gq2uvpgN3jushg_GF1J2zna85F-/view?usp=sharing

If you'd like the images to have the same width for consistency with others, we'll need to crop some parts of the images to match the dimensions. Please review and let us know how you'd like to proceed.
