It seems we are unable to restore this landing page as it has been many years and we don't have backup files as well. 

Recommended Approach,
We suggest redesigning the landing page from scratch. As the design files provided is in PSD format, we recommend converting it to Figma and sharing the Figma link with us.

We'll then proceed with the development in custom HTML on dev site for your review before pushing it live.

Key Notes & Clarifications Before Development: 

- The form is a standard contact form, no CRM or third-party integrations involved.

- We'll use the following message after the form submission unless youâ€™d like to revise it:
"Thank you for your message, we will be in touch shortly. If you would like to speak with someone sooner, please call {phone number}."

- Additionally we require SMTP configuration. Please provide the SMTP email credentials to be used for sending form emails.
-- Add this email to the Passbolt folder: https://chamber.smartsites.com/app/folders/view/4f3c9c81-c90d-47ed-a564-1b2954b9c3a7
-- Enable 2FA (TOTP)
-- Ensure FED has read and update access

- Would you like us to include a sticky footer on the landing page?

- Where should Call To Action buttons lead to? What is the action of them?

- Please provide testimonials content as we are unable to download the doc provided in comment #1.
