As per comment #19,

Regarding your request for a time estimation to create new pages, We want to provide a tentative outlook based on the Design Team's recent audit and their recommendations for a full redesign of our existing pages.

The design team identified several issues with the current pages, including oversized sections, misaligned elements, and a lack of modern design. They have proposed two main approaches for addressing these issues:

1. Full Redesign Approach
2. Alternative Approach - Focusing on Specific Issues

Tentative Estimation for New Page Creation:

While the above estimates are for redesigning existing pages, we understand you need a rough estimation for creating entirely new pages. Since no designs are currently available for these new pages, we must provide a preliminary estimate based on what we consider a "normal" new page with standard layouts and functionalities.

>> New Homepage Development: Estimated 16-18 hours. A homepage is typically the most complex page, involving unique layouts, diverse content sections, advanced interactive elements, and critical integrations. Without designs, this is a broad estimate to cover the foundational structure and initial component integration.

>> New Subpages Development: Estimated 4-8 hours per page. 

>> Homepage Revamp: Estimated 4-6 hours.

>> Inner Pages: Estimated 2-4 hours per page.

Important Considerations for New Pages:

This is a highly tentative estimate as we do not have specific designs or detailed requirements yet. The actual time needed will vary significantly once the final designs are provided.

More complex or "fancy" designs that involve unique layouts, or intricate interactive elements will naturally require additional development time, and the estimation will increase accordingly.

To provide a more accurate estimation for new pages, we recommend finalizing the design scope and complexity. Once designs are ready, we can refine our time estimates.

Please let us know which of the two redesign approaches the design team intends to pursue, and we can then discuss the specific requirements for new pages further.

Notes:- Since the site is built on Elementor, we’ll be working within its limitations. We’ll notify you of any platform constraints or issues we encounter during the build.
