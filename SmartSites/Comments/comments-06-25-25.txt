Re: Please also include an additional box to the "we offer" section in both dyslexia and charter pages (Center boxes) for "Scoring Services" (Use icon attached)

However, to maintain consistency with the other icons (which are blue), please provide a blue version of the image. We attempted to convert the current image to blue, but the result appeared blurry (see screenshot below).

Additionally, we're also a bit unclear on the instructions. Should the 'We Offer' section from Charter page also be added to the Dyslexia page? If so, please confirm the exact placement.

Re: For the Dyslexia page, the tabs are still closed. Please have ALL open by default.

As per comment #2,

In point 4, you've mentioned that the landing page should be done in HTML (if this can be coded on Unbounce). Please confirm which approach we should follow based on the process below, and provide us with detailed instructions accordingly. Once we receive confirmation, we’ll proceed with the landing page development using the appropriate method and update other provided details accordingly, based on what's feasible.

For Unbounce Landing Page:
--------------------------
1. Since Unbounce is a self-hosted platform, we’re unable to host a custom HTML landing page directly on it.

2. We require delegate access to Unbounce via web@smartsites.com. Since Unbounce doesn't support custom HTML coding, we'll need to use its native page builder. This limits customization options, meaning we’ll only be able to work within the default builder features, including for forms. Therefore, we will be restricted to the default features without the ability to make extensive customizations, and as a result, we may not be able to fully match the current design provided.

3. As Unbounce is a new platform for us, we will need to spend time researching and familiarizing ourselves with it. This will likely result in approximately 2.5x more working hours compared to our usual process.

4. FYI: We may not be able to add the CallRail snippet as provided in Unbounce. We will look into this further, but at this point, we cannot confirm whether it will be possible.


For HTML Landing Page:
-----------------------
1. We require hosting access to complete the landing page in HTML. While we currently have CMS access only.

2. Once received, we'll begin development and provide updates on dev for your review. After approval, we'll publish the landing page live under the folder's names personal-injury-attorney-atlanta and car-accident-attorney-atlanta (e.g., atlantapiattorney.com/personal-injury-attorney-atlanta and atlantapiattorney.com/car-accident-attorney-atlanta as mentioned).


For CMS (WordPress + Elementor or WordPress + Custom) Landing Page:
---------------------------------------------
1. Since the site, https://www.atlantapiattorney.com/, is built on WordPress, and Elementor plugin is installed as well. If we proceed with building the landing page within the CMS, here are the available options:

a. If the landing page is to be built using Elementor, we require CMS access, which we already have via Passbolt upon checking.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Ak5HvikG6bJAv4XEY7pTJ4tMpMJIxnB/view?usp=sharing

b. Once confirmed, we will develop the page in DRAFT mode in live for your review and confirm with you before publishing it live.

c. However, upon review, we noticed that the site is currently usingthe  free version of Elementor, and Elementor Pro is not installed as well. This limits customization options, and we may not be able to fully match with the design.
SS - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q9NrR1mph9hk5dKeBaOHg8vmtIdhj4my/view?usp=sharing

4. Additionally, it appears that most of the pages on the site are not built using Elementor but are instead custom-coded. Since the current active theme is developed by another agency, we will need hosting access to review the theme structure at the code level. This will help us align our new custom landing pages appropriately. 

5. Optionally, we can also make the landing page content editable (dynamic) through WordPress, but this will require additional working hours.

Notes: 

Please provide necessary access details (FTP/cPanel/Hosting/domain) on a separate task, https://login.smartsites.com/projects/7145/tasks/370007, so we can check in detail to launch the landing page smoothly.

For optimal landing page performance, we recommend providing a video link from a streaming platform such as YouTube, Vimeo, or similar (if available), rather than a direct video file. This approach ensures faster load times and better compatibility across devices.







Re: HTML should work. Can you see if this can be coded on unbounce?
>> It can be done in Unbounce, but due to certain restrictions, it won't match exactly with the original design. Also, we can't create our own custom form — we can only implement the form what is on Unbounce's default form layout. So we will prefer the custom HTML for that.....

Re: More importantly, the case studies for VIKINGS, LEXUS PORSCHE are still wrong.

Please review the doc below provided in comment #4, and ensure all changes done.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B6JyWJXIEERpVXRwkIJnk3hlr0gHMHKQ-z6r7b693mI/edit?tab=t.0

case studies for VIKINGS
>> Case study type for Vikings is wrong (it's the Can AM copy) but photos are fine.
Suggestions: It seems content needs to updated as per the Can AM (But where should we find content for the Can AM, please proceed with asking PM to provide it, if needed).

case studies for LEXUS
Suggestions: It seems to related with content update as well, please proceed with asking PM about the content.

case studies for PORSCHE
>> Also this PORSCHE photos and body copy are wrong...it's for an old case study for Nordstroms.
Suggestions: It seems to related with content update as well  and need to update as per an old case study for Nordstroms (but where we can find this content), please proceed with asking PM to provide it.

>> The headline for the LA KINGS case study page incorrectly says "Bandanas" please make that say LA KINGS

As per comment #19,

Since you've mentioned that the landing page should also be implemented via WordPress so that it aligns with the rest of their site. Please confirm which approach we should follow based on the process below, and provide us with detailed instructions accordingly. Once we receive confirmation, we’ll proceed with the appropriate method and publish the landing page.

For HTML Landing Page:

Now we’re able to host a custom HTML landing page on the domain and proceed with publishing the landing page live. For that, we will be creating the folder name fighting-for-you and uploading HTML files there (e.g., https://www.yampaglia-law.com/fighting-for-you as mentioned).

For CMS (WordPress) landing page:

If the landing page is to be published in WordPress CMS with the same URL as above, i.e., https://www.yampaglia-law.com/fighting-for-you, we need to convert the custom HTML landing page into WordPress and create a page for it, along with updating the form to Gravity Form accordingly. But this will require additional working hours, approx 2 to 4 hours

Optionally, we can also make the landing page content editable (dynamic) through WordPress, but this will also require additional working hours, approx 8 to 10 hours.

============================================

As per comment #2,

We encountered issues when editing pages, as they were taking like forever to load. After troubleshooting, we identified the 'CDN Enabler' plugin as the root cause and have temporarily disabled it on dev site to resolve the issue.

Currently, we've updated new pages URLs in Column AH of the New Website Plan for your review. We're currently working on the remaining pages and will provide further updates by Wednesday, 2nd July.

Workbook - New Website Plan: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jH-2HpPVmpM_-C1OHOw07ZzZugy4wesvllrEWgfkbpw/edit?gid=406948056#gid=406948056
