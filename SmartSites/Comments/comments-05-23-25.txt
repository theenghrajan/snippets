In addition to comment #2, and please also respond our queries on there as well.

We've updated the page on dev site for your review.

Dev URL:- https://njrhomeservices.smartwebsitedesign.com/win2025/

Most of the elements on the design are static images so we have implement as static images for now. Please provide exportable design so we can access and implement the necessary elements (text, icons etc). Specifically for these sections,

As we've also mentioned in comment #2, that some sections are not exportable (see screenshots below), they are just static images for whole sections. Please provide an exportable design so we can access the necessary elements (text, icons, etc). Otherwise, we'll have to add them as static images for the block, as they are currently.

As per the comment #36,

Re: Client emailed me stating that the thank you message for the https://abdominoplasty.nyc/ landing page needs to be updated. I will provide an additional comment with the thank you message once I confirm with client.
>> Please informed us once confirm so we can proceed with updating the thank you message.

Re: Could you please double check and see where the email of tummytuck.solutions@gmail.com could be coming from? Did we set up? Any additional information you can provide would be very much appreciated!
>> Yes, we previously configured 'tummytuck.solutions@gmail.com' as the SMTP email sender for https://abdominoplasty.nyc/, so the forms are currently being sent using this email address.

Please let us know if this is helpful. If you have any queries, feel free to reach out.
