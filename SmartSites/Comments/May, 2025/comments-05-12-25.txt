As per the task descriptions,

Since you've mentioned the site, https://entrinsik.com/ is built on WordPress using the SiteOrigin builder and the LiveMesh theme. We may not be able to implement all the changes as specified due to the limitations of the builder, particularly in terms of layouts, modules, and funtionality.

We will need to thoroughly review and research each of the mentioned points to determine what is feasible. If certain changes are possible, we’ll provide an estimate for the work. If not, we may recommend building a new site for greater flexibility and functionality.

Additionally, we couldn’t locate the Workbook link in the project’s notes section. Please share it so we can proceed with a more complete review.

According to our task proceeding rules, we do not work on tasks related to the Design Team or any other specific team. Therefore, we have created a new task and will continue our work there: https://login.smartsites.com/projects/6955/tasks/363837. Since we have no further work remaining on this task, please proceed to close it. If any work is still pending for the Design Team, kindly assign it to them.

The site is built with Beaver builder and it has many limitations. We'll implement as per the design as much as possible. If we encounter any limitations or issues while working, we’ll inform you.

We've estimated approximately 12 to 16 hours to develop the location single page as per the provided design. Please confirm to proceed.





In addition to comment #12,




We've estimated approximately 5 to 7 hours for the development of the page, as per the design provided in comment #11. However, the current Elementor license is not currently active, and due to its limitations, we might be unable to match the design and use some elements.

Please confirm to proceed and we will set the due date for completion accordingly.

We didn’t see any mention about whether we’re supposed to work on the live environment or the dev environment. Please confirm which environment we should be working on. Usually, we first work on the dev environment, get it reviewed by you, and then push it to live. However, you've provided live URLs on the task descriptions, please clarify.

We've estimated around 4 to 6 hours for completion on dev site for review.

Note: The current Elementor license is not active, there will be certain limitations and prevent us from fully matching the design. However, we will implement the design as closely as possible within the available capabilities.

According to our task proceeding rules, we do not work on tasks related to the Design Team or any other specific team.
