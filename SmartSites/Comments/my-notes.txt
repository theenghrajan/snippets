In the current context, all content is stored within the description field. To create a toggle feature, we need to create a separate field. If we fetch the product description from this newly created field, we can implement the toggle functionality. However, in Shopify, it’s not possible to toggle only certain parts of the content while leaving the rest unchanged. We would need to manage the entire description as a single unit for the toggle to work.

If the client wants the bold text in the description to be pulled from a separate field, we can create a new field specifically for that bold text.


Should we proceed with the updates and replace them to the current landing page, https://3plcenter.com/lp/? We have estimated approximately 10 - 12 hours for coding updates. However, we will handle the task related to the conversion tracking on separate task once we completed the coding parts, we will inform you.

We found the forms have been disabled from the admin currently. Should we enable the specific form and apply them as per the design? Please confirm.

Thank You!

As per comment #1 - #7,

1. We've published the landing page at https://rvroofingpros.com/lp/
Fullpage ss - https://drive.google.com/file/d/19VAlPBtMjAp3HlE32C73gHTb4KWn9its/view?usp=sharing

2. We've tested the form and it is working fine, for now. SMTP ID currently we've set up is with outbound@smartsites.com but we require new separate one. This is because outbound@smartsites.com is our development account and normally the quota limit is reached and there is a form submission issue in the future. So the form will only work for couple of days only.

3. Details regarding SMTP:
You can create one as noreply_{domain_name}@gmail.com and provide the login details. It is essential to enable 2FA to set up the SMTP ID, so we require a phone number for this or maybe set up 2FA on SmartSites phone number so we can get the code with no time restriction. We again need to co-ordinate for 2FA, if necessary.

4. After testing the form, we've changed the email recipient to 'ira@rvroofingpros.com'.

5. Re: Honeypot and Google reCAPTCHA
>> We are inprogress with implement them and we can only provide updates on this by Thursday, 27th February. Therefore, we've set the due date accordingly.

Thank You!

As per comment #16,

Queries:

1. Re: product page edit points
In the current context, all content is stored within the description field. To create a toggle feature, we need to create a separate field. If we fetch the product description from this newly created field, we can implement the toggle functionality. However, in Shopify, it’s not possible to toggle only certain parts of the content while leaving the rest unchanged. We would need to manage the entire description as a single unit for the toggle to work.

If the client wants the bold text in the description to be pulled from a separate field, we can create a new field specifically for that bold text.

Re: removal of the QR code and video
>> We will need 1 to 2 hours for this no additional 3-5 hours.

3. Re: Suggested Products section
We will test them on draft and the estimation is around 2-4 hours, and if it doesn’t work out, then we will suggest alternatives third-party app accordingly.

You can find these queries on the estimation sheet as well. We've commented them on specific cell.

As per comment #9,

1. We've changed the email recipient to 'sales@rvroofingpros.com'.

2. However, we're getting ERROR while generating site key for RECAPTCHA, so we've currently disabled it.

3. Could you please provide us WordPress admin login details, so we could check issues regarding reCAPTCHA.

Thank You!

We recommend providing delegate access to web@smartsites.com with client name. Currently, we can't logged in with the client login detail for the GoDaddy due to 2FA verification.

Thank You!


We've checked/QA the landing page, https://cyber1armor.com and see below queries/updates as per mentioned in the comments #27 - #28,

1. Currently the form is not working due to SMTP ID setup with our development google account, "outbound@smartsites.com" as we have also mentioned in the comment #19 that the form will stop working after a few days(normally due to the quota limit is reached). So we required the login credentials of "sixdotsllc@gmail.com" which you have mentioned to use as SMTP.

Additionally we may need to go through 2FA while setting up SMTP because it is essential to enable 2FA and for that we required the phone number. We will be available at 11 AM NJ EST for 2FA coordination Friday, 28th February.

2. We have updated the logos as provided in the attachment but could not find the Microsoft Security logo in the attachment. Please provide it.
We have also removed "Trusted by over 8,000+ organizations" text.

We've spent 1h 15m of working hours for reviewing and coding. Since the website is built on BigCommerce, a platform we're not very familiar with - the review process took an additional hour.
