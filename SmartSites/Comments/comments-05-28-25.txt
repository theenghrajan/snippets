As per comment #10,

Removing Twitter icon on dev site:
>> Should we proceed with removing the twitter icon site-wide on dev site for now?

Re: The only place the changes did not take affect were on the /summersavings page. Can we get that removed please.
>> As we've mentioned already on comment #4, /summersavings page is redirecting to https://njrhomeservices.smartwebsitedesign.com/buy-an-air-conditioner/ on dev site and can't access the page currently.

If you are referring to remove twitter icon on the landing page on site: https://www.njrhomeservices.com/summersavings/, then please re-assigned the task back to us and we will proceed accordingly.

As we've mentioned in comment #2 as well, some sections are not exportable and are just static images for whole sections (see screenshots below). Please reach out and provide exportable design so we can access the necessary elements (texts, icons etc). We've implemented them as a images for the whole sections for now.

Please reassign the task, and we will proceed with the header updates as mentioned. However, please note that we may need to compromises on the responsive/mobile design due to current layout structure not being fully compatible with responsive adjustments.
