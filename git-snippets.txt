And this will launch your visual diff tool (if configured):
git difftool HEAD^ HEAD

As the previous commit can be accessed with HEAD^
git diff HEAD^ HEAD

That also can be applied for a :commithash
git diff $commithash^ $commithash

The following will also work:
git show

If you want to know the diff between head and any commit you can use:
git diff commit_id HEAD

As of Git 1.8.5, @ is an alias for HEAD, so you can use:
git diff @~..@

## Delete recent commits from any git branch locally and remotely
# reset to recent commits from git log
$ git reset <commit_id>

# delete recent commit remotely (this is very dangeroue git command as it is force remove)
$ git push origin master -f


## Git config, use token key and once username and password added no need to repeat as it stores the credential with following git config

$ git config --global credential.helper store

# Filename too long in Git for Windows
git config --system core.longpaths true
