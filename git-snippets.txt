And this will launch your visual diff tool (if configured):
git difftool HEAD^ HEAD

As the previous commit can be accessed with HEAD^
git diff HEAD^ HEAD

That also can be applied for a :commithash
git diff $commithash^ $commithash

The following will also work:
git show

If you want to know the diff between head and any commit you can use:
git diff commit_id HEAD

As of Git 1.8.5, @ is an alias for HEAD, so you can use:
git diff @~..@

## Delete recent commits from any git branch locally and remotely
# reset to recent commits from git log
$ git reset <commit_id>

# delete recent commit remotely (this is very dangeroue git command as it is force remove)
$ git push origin master -f


## Git config, use token key and once username and password added no need to repeat as it stores the credential with following git config
# to enable credentials storage in Git
$ git config --global credential.helper store

# Filename too long in Git for Windows
git config --system core.longpaths true

## Use Generic proxy in FileZilla
Simply select HTTP/1.1 using CONNECT method from the Setting > Generic proxy and fill proxy credentials as shown in the screenshot as well.

Merging via command line
=========================
If you do not want to use the merge button or an automatic merge cannot be performed, you can perform a manual merge on the command line. However, the following steps are not applicable if the base branch is protected.

Step 1 Clone the repository or update your local repository with the latest changes.
git pull origin master

Step 2 Switch to the base branch of the pull request.
git checkout master

Step 3 Merge the head branch into the base branch.
git merge 9-wp-dev-for-the-custom-html

Step 4 Push the changes.
git push -u origin master

This will remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain:
$ git clean -fdx
WARNING: -x will also remove all ignored files, including ones specified by .gitignore! You may want to use -n for preview of files to be deleted.
