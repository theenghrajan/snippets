And this will launch your visual diff tool (if configured):
git difftool HEAD^ HEAD

As the previous commit can be accessed with HEAD^
git diff HEAD^ HEAD

That also can be applied for a :commithash
git diff $commithash^ $commithash

The following will also work:
git show

If you want to know the diff between head and any commit you can use:
git diff commit_id HEAD

As of Git 1.8.5, @ is an alias for HEAD, so you can use:
git diff @~..@

Warnings
@ScottF and @Panzercrisis explain in the comments that on Windows the ~ character must be used instead of ^
