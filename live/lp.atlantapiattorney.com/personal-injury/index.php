              <h4>Special Counsel</h4>
              <p>Attorney Richard Kopelman has practiced law since 1987. During the early years of his legal career, Richard represented insurance companies and big businesses but quickly realized that his true calling was representing plaintiffs in personal injury claims and lawsuits. Richard is passionate about helping others, a champion of the underdog, and an aggressive personal injury advocate.</p>
              <p>In 1991, Richard dedicated his career to personal injury law. He is licensed in federal and state courts across the state and is well-versed in mass tort, multidistrict litigation (MDL), where he represents clients on the local, statewide, and national levels. With significant experience in the insurance industry, Richard knows how to identify weak opposing arguments and exploit them for the benefit of his client.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-4 lg:mb-6">
              <h4>Impressive Record of Success</h4>
              <p>Richard’s success includes a multitude of substantial settlements and jury verdicts, including at least one million-dollar settlement. This accomplishment earned him a place in the Million Dollar Advocates Forum®. Today, he continues to build a reputation for excellence in the legal community as he strives to become the most skilled and well-prepared legal advocate in the greater Atlanta area.</p>
              <p>As a client’s advocate, Richard believes that “It is [my] responsibility, in fact [my] duty…to make the members of the jury feel like they have known the client all of his or her life, because only then can jurors truly understand the devastating effects of the client’s injury. Without such an understanding, a jury cannot possibly return a just and proper verdict in our client’s favor.”</p>

              <p>Todd worked on my case non-stop for almost three years and reached a great settlement at the end. It was a complicated case (motorcycle accident) and he worked very hard on it . He carries himself very well and is very knowledgeable. He does his homework and research on your case down to the last detail. I would highly recommend this attorney for any personal injury case! Great honest man!!</p>

              <p>"Mr. Henningsen was the first person I called after I had a car accident that totaled my car. He was great from the very beginning, he informed me of all of my right s and always called to see how I was feeling. Throughout the whole process he let me know what was going on, what information he needed and when we would hear back from the at fault party's insurance company. In a short amount of time he was able to get me a great settlement and took care of paying all of my medical bills. I thank him all the time and would definitely recommend using Mr. Henningsen if you have been injured in a car accident!"</p>

              <p>"I had the pleasure of being represented by Mr. Henningsen in an full accident case. I was injured and had accumulated several medical bills. I was contacted by the insurance company and offered a settlement much lower than expected for the amount of t ime and treatments that I had received due to those injuries. Mr. Henningsen accepted my case and went right to work for me right away! Within weeks and several follow ups from Mr. Henningsen himself he called to let me know that not only was he able to double what they had offered to settle my case but that he was able to collect the maximum on the policy. I now have what I know to be one of the best, professional, ethical and personable attorneys on my side and will use him again."</p>

              <p>"I was introduced to Henngsen Injury Attorneys by a friend. I have been represented by this great firm twice in the past 3 years, each time I had the privilege of having the representation of Paralegal Tamera Smith and Mr. Henningsen as my attorney . If I had to describe this team in four words it would be; tenacious, brilliant, strategic, and compassionate. This team helped me achieve the highest settlement in my life time. I pray that I won't endure another collision, however in the event that it happens again I will not hesitate to call Henningsen Injury Attorneys." </p>
