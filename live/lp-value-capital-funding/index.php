			<h2>Understanding Your Situation</h2>
			<p>MCA debt can make your business feel like it's under siege. These advances provide immediate funds in exchange for a portion of future sales, but the devil is in the details. Fixed daily repayments, irrespective of your sales volume, can lead to a cycle of debt that's hard to break.</p>
			<p>The good news? MCA companies are not interested in shutting down your business. They prefer settlements over expensive and uncertain legal battles. This gives you leverage. Our guide helps you understand this leverage and use it to your advantage.</p>
